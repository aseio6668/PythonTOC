# Python to C++ Translation Report

## Code Analysis
- Functions: 1
- Classes: 0
- Imports: 2
- Estimated lines: 74
- Max nesting depth: 15

## Type Inference
- Variables with inferred types: 18
- Functions with return types: 0

## Translation Notes
- Memory management: Consider using smart pointers for object lifetimes
- Error handling: Python exceptions should be converted to C++ exceptions
- Performance: Review generated code for optimization opportunities

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Review generated C++ code for correctness
2. Add proper type annotations to improve translation
3. Test the generated code with appropriate inputs
4. Consider adding CMake build configuration
5. Add unit tests for the translated functions
